# inquill | custom pen plotter
designed and building a low-cost, fully 3d-printable, foldable, beginner-friendly cnc pen plotter that can be assembled/run without soldering, plots svg to g-code extracted from vector drawings and uses standard components while running on open-source grbl firmware 

## features
- compact, foldable and can be stored easily
- frame, arms, pulleys, carriage, and pen holder are all 3d-printed
- uses arduino uno + nema 17 steppers + cnc shield + a4988 drivers + sg90 servo
- plots svg to g-code extracted from vector drawings (using inkscape & gcodetools)
- pen lift (servo powered z-axis enables pen up/down control)
- beginner-friendly and can be assembled and run without any soldering

## building process
i'll be journalling my daily efforts in the form of blocks of text (with my silly little thoughts + progress on the project) which can be promptly viewed at [journal.md](journal.md) where i document myself deep in the trenches of unfamiliar circuitry becauseeee ... i might not have the knowledge, the expertise or credentials/qualifications, but i have ambition, caffeinated beverages and internet access to keep me company & that's enough :D
